# Challenge

For the refracted code of "All Stocks Analysis", arrays for tickers, totalDailyVolume, startingPrice, and endingPrices were set and given a size of 50.  This accomodates future addition of more stocks to be analysed. 

The code is now refracted  for all variables to be  dynamic so that when future stocks are added (up to 50), the program would still run correctly. 

There are no nested loops in the code so that all information is gathered in one pass.
